# C++ Practice Repository for D.A.S.

This is my personal repository where I am practicing and improving my C++ skills. It's a collection of exercises that I've worked on, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming (OOP) practices. 

Here's what you'll find in this repository:

- **Data Structures**: I've implemented and used various data structures in C++. 
- **Algorithms**: I've solved problems using different algorithms, which has helped me enhance my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic efficiency.
- **OOP Practices**: I've practiced object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Unit Testing**: I use [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x) for unit testing, which provides a robust framework to ensure the correctness of my code. Each exercise comes with a corresponding test file.

I use a Makefile for building and running the programs and tests, which makes it easy for me to compile and test the code. This repository serves as a record of my journey learning and mastering C++. Feel free to explore and learn from it!

## MakeFile Commands

1. `make build_main`: This command compiles and links the source files to create the main program binary.
2. `make build_test`: This command compiles and links the source and test files to create the test program binary.
3. `make run`: This command runs the main program.
4. `make test`: This command runs the test program.
5. `make clean`: This command removes the build directory and all its contents.

To run these commands, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Makefile, and enter the command you want to run.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
